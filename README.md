# Deno Web Polyfill
A polyfill that enables (limited) usage of the [Deno namespace](https://deno.land/api@v1.38.0?s=Deno) in browsers.

The goal of this project is to get the majority of `Deno.*` APIs to work within the constraints of a browser environment.
This polyfill is used in the [unyt.land CDN](https://github.com/unyt-org/unyt.land).
